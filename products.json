Its mechanical basis was the existing 2JZ-GE, but differed in its use of sequential twin turbochargers and an air-to-air side-mounted intercooler. The engine block, crankshaft and connecting rods of the Supra's 2JZ-GE and 2JZ-GTE are the same, with notable differences being that the 2JZ-GTE has recessed piston tops (giving a lower compression ratio), oil spray nozzles to aid in cooling the pistons and a different head (redesigned inlet/exhaust ports, cams and valves). Toyota's VVT-i variable valve timing technology was added to the engine beginning in September 1997, hence it phased out production of the original engine. Consequently, maximum torque and horsepower was raised for engines selling in all markets. The later 2JZ-GE VVT-i equipped models (Aristo, Altezza and Mark II) share a different part number for weaker connecting rods.\r\nThe addition of twin turbochargers, jointly developed by Toyota with Hitachi, in sequential configuration had raised its commercially cited output from 230 PS (169 kW; 227 hp) to the contemporary industry maximum of 280 PS (206 kW; 276 hp) at 5600 rpm. In its first appearance, torque was advertised as 44.3 kg⋅m (320 lb⋅ft; 434 N⋅m) at 4000 rpm, to be later recited as 46 kg⋅m (333 lb⋅ft; 451 N⋅m) with the introduction VVT-i in production year 1997. The mutually agreed, industry-wide output ceiling was enforced by Japan's now-defunct Gentlemen's Agreement exclusively between Japanese automakers selling to the Japanese domestic market. Engine power in the North American and European markets, as documented by Toyota, was increased to 320 hp (239 kW; 324 PS) at 5600 rpm.\r\nThe export version of the 2JZ-GTE achieved its higher power output with the use of newer stainless steel turbochargers (ceramic for Japanese models), revised camshafts and larger injectors (550 cc/min for export, 440 cc/min for Japanese). The mechanical similarities between the Japanese-specification CT20 turbine and export-specification CT12B turbine allow interchangeability of the exhaust-side propeller shaft. Additionally, the export-exclusive CT12B turbine received more durable turbine housings and stainless steel turbine and impeller fins. Multiple variants of the Japanese CT20 turbine exist discretely, which are identified with the B, R, and A part number suffixes (e.g.: CT20A)."}}, {"model": "store.product", "pk": 2, "fields": {"name": "Nissan RB26DETT", "price": "45000.00", "digital": false, "image": "nissan-rb26dett-engine.jpg", "description": "The RB26DETT engine is a 2.6 L (2,568 cc) Inline-six engine manufactured by Nissan for use in the 1989-2002 Nissan Skyline GT-R. The RB26DETT engine block is made from cast iron, while the cylinder head is made from aluminium alloy, which contains DOHC 4 valves per cylinder (24 valves in total) setup. The intake of the RB26DETT varies from other RB-series motors in that it has six individual (3 sets of 2 throttle assemblies that are siamesed together) instead of a single throttle body. The engine also uses a parallel twin-turbo system, using a pair of T25-type ceramic turbochargers set by the wastegates to limit boost pressure to 10 psi (0.69 bar), although the Skyline GT-R has a built in boost restrictor to keep boost under 14 psi (0.97 bar).\r\nThe first 2.6 L RB26DETT was rated by Nissan at around 276 bhp (280 PS; 206 kW) at 6,800 rpm and 353 N⋅m; 260 lbf⋅ft (36 kg⋅m) at 4,400 rpm. By the end of production, power levels had gone up to around 320 PS (235 kW; 316 hp) at 6,800 rpm and 392 N⋅m; 289 lbf⋅ft (40 kg⋅m) at 4,400 rpm, not only because of developments and modifications to the engine, but also because of the \"Gentlemen's Agreement\" made between automakers to limit the \"advertised\" horsepower of any vehicle to 280 PS (276 bhp; 206 kW). While the published figures from Nissan were as quoted above, it has been known among enthusiasts that the car actually had a factory power output closer to the 320 PS (235 kW; 316 hp) figure. The RB26 is widely known and became quite popular for its strength and power potential thanks to its iron block and forged internals, making it a modification friendly platform for tuners and aftermarket modifications in general.\r\nThere is a common oiling problem with the pre-1992 R32 RB26 motors, as the surface where the crankshaft meets the oil pump was machined too small, eventually leading to oil pump failure at high rpm. This issue was resolved in later versions of the RB26 with a wider oil pump drive. Aftermarket performance parts makers also make oil pump extension drive collars to rectify this problem. More recently a spline drive solution has been developed by an aftermarket tuner Supertec Racing who moves away from the OEM flat drive system and uses splines to drive the oil pump gears in the same way as Toyota's 1JZ-GTE engine as found in the Supra MKIII. This kit is available for most uprated RB26 oil pumps including Nissans own OEM, N1 and Nismo although most high hp RB engines all over the world have been proven to be reliable without spline driven oil pumps when built and tuned correctly.\r\nBesides minor cosmetic updates and ECU fine tunings, changes were made in the R34 generation to ball bearing T28 turbochargers as opposed to journal bearing turbos. The R34 GT-R turbos retained the ceramic exhaust turbine wheel. Models that had steel exhaust turbine wheels included the R32 Nismo, R32-R33-R34 N1 models and R34 Nür spec skyline GT-Rs.\r\nOriginally the R32 GT-R was planned to have a 2.4L RB24DETT and compete in the 4000 cc class (in Group A rules, the displacement is multiplied by 1.7 if the engine is turbocharged). This was when Nismo was going through the process of designing the R32 GT-R to be a Group A race car. But, when the engineers added the AWD system, they found it made the car heavier than expected and, as a result, much less competitive. Nismo made the decision to make the engine a 2.6L twin turbo and compete in the higher 4500 cc class, resulting in the RB26DETT known today."}}, {"model": "store.product", "pk": 3, "fields": {"name": "BMW S54", "price": "10000.00", "digital": false, "image": "bmw-s54-engine.jpg", "description": "The S54 was marketed as the high performance equivalent to the M54, however, it is actually more an evolution of the BMW S50 and shares few parts with the M54.
