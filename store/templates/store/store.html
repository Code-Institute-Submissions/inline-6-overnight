        <h4><strong>A Word On the Inline-6 Engine</strong></h4>
    </div>
    <br/><br/>
    <p>
        Nowadays, the Nissan RB26DETT, the Toyota 2JZ-GTE and the BMW S54 engines are the best-known inline-6s 
        around (we sell these and others on our website). Sometimes we call them inline-6s, straight-6s or even 
        slant-6s (because they're installed at a 30-degree angle), but they're all six-cylinder engines arranged in 
        a straight line along the crankshaft. Having all the cylinders in a row makes an inline-six inherently 
        balanced.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a piston engine, there's a lot of moving parts. The pistons move up and down, and they have inertia. And, 
        every time they change direction, they exert what are called primary forces. That translates into engine 
        vibration. Primary means that these forces happen only once per revolution of the crankshaft. Secondary 
        forces are also related to the pistons' up and down movement. But they're just a little bit different 
        because of where they're exerted. If the piston starts at top dead center, on the first 90 degrees of 
        crankshaft rotation, the piston travels a little bit further than halfway through its whole stroke. That's 
        because of the way the connecting rod attaches the piston to the crank. From 90 to 270 degrees of crank 
        rotation, the piston doesn't travel quite as far. Then, from 270 to 360 degrees, it goes a bit further again. 
        Since each portion of the movement happens in the same amount of time, that means the piston is traveling a 
        little faster in the top half of its stroke than in the bottom half. These different speeds are the 
        secondary forces that cause an imbalance of the engine, which means more vibration. An inline-six operates 
        like two inline three-cylinder engines placed end-to-end. The pistons move as mirrored image parts. With one 
        and six, two and five, and three and four always moving in tandem. When one pair is at top dead center, a 
        second pair is moving downward and the third pair is moving upward. That cancels out the primary forces. 
        Then, each of the crank throws is separated by 120 degrees, which cancels out the secondary forces. The 
        result is that the engine naturally runs smoothly. And it sounds pretty good, too.
    </p>

        Another advantage to a straight-six is that putting all the cylinders in a line is a really simple layout. 
        It only needs one basic engine block, one cylinder head, one valve cover and one set of valvetrain 
        components. Since it's naturally balanced, there's no need to add balance shafts or anything extra to smooth 
        it out. That makes it both a little cheaper to produce and much easier to work on.

        This shape also leaves a lot of extra space along the sides of the engine bay for performance enhancers like 
        turbos and exhaust headers (please see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaJ35vVQ9A" target="_blank"
